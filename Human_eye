this is detail for all concept related to HUman Eye:
human eye is something that makes us see the objestc sorround us: it is just like camera natural camera that god made:

lets study in deatil about the various parts of human eye:

there are three layesrs in an human eye:
1) the first layer in human eye is known as sclera:
2)the second layer in human eye is known as choroid:
3) the thirld layer in human eye is known as retina and also known ad aankh ka parda:

** the complete eye is photoreceptor organ means that revive light and make image:

optic nerve: it carries the information of image to central nerveous system means brain:

cornea: the transparent and the front part of an human eye is known as cornea:
inside human eye there is lens known as convex lens:
the liquid that is filled in front part of eye is known as aquois humour and it is in front part of eye the part that we are able to see:

the liquid that is in inside the eyes is known as vitous humour it is filled with liquied:
color of eye is responsible is iris:
size of that small circle when light increse it decrses and when light decrses it incresse is known as Pupil:

** retina consist of two cells:
1) one is rod cells and one is cone cells:

i)rod cells: theye are responsible for all white and black thing we are able to see:
ii)cone cells are responsible for all colourful:

inside human eye the tears get form from lacrimal gland:

human eye form the real and inverted image on retina:

least distance for human eye vision is 25 CM:

MYOPIA:
Can see the nearby object but not the ditsant object this is known as MYOPIA:
solution of this is concave lens so you are using an diverging lens there:
reason is due to elongation of eye ball and decreaded focal length:

Hypermetropia:
can see the distant object clearly but not nearby object this is known as hypermetropia:
solution is convex lens:
reason is due to shortening of eye ball and increased focal length:

presbyopia: 
it occurs in old age people thats why they are not able to see the distant and nearby object clearly:
solution use an bifocal lens:
