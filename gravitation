gravitation is force that attarcts tow masses together in single:

gravitationol force is something that attracts two masses  together in single frame:

universal gravitatinol constant is 6.67* 10 ^-11

acceleration due to gravity is 9.8  and formula is GM/R^2 here G is gravitatinol constant and M ia mass od earth and R is the radius of earth:

keplers law of planertry motion:

1) keplers first law: it is law of orbit:  here earth and sum is at one other focii and earth revolve arround sun

2)keplers second law: it is law of equal areas: the grabitatinol force is more at neare the sun and here they move at speed and while ut is distant from that place:


3)keplers thirld law: it is law of periods: here gravitatinol force is and time to revolve around sun is directly propetionol to R^3 means equal to   T^2 =R^3
