it is the part of science where we study about energy and its part of energy: heat energy and work:
\

it consist of three parts:

1)system: the part of universe which is under observation is system:
2)sorroundings: the rest part of universe which is not system in known as sorroudings:
3)system + soroorundinsg is known as universe:

System:
1) Open system: where you are able to exchange both mass and energy from sorrounding is jnown as open system:
2) closed system when you are abale to exchange

1)Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with the study of heat, work, energy, 
and the laws governing the conversion of one form of energy into another, 
along with the behavior of systems in equilibrium.

2)✅ Thermodynamic System

A thermodynamic system is a specific quantity of matter or a region in space chosen for study,
separated from its surroundings by a real or imaginary boundary.

Types of Thermodynamic Systems
🔹 1. Open System

A system that can exchange both mass and energy (heat or work) with its surroundings.

Example:
Boiling water in an open pot, human body, steam turbine.

🔹 2. Closed System

A system that can exchange energy (heat or work) but not mass with its surroundings.

Example:
A sealed pressure cooker, gas in a piston cylinder (without leakage).

🔹 3. Isolated System

A system that cannot exchange either mass or energy with its surroundings.

Example:
A perfectly insulated thermos bottle (ideal case), universe (approx).


✅ State of a System

The state of a thermodynamic system is the condition of the system at a given moment, 
described by its measurable properties such as pressure, temperature, volume, and composition.

📌 Important Points

A thermodynamic state is fully defined by state variables/properties
(P, V, T, internal energy, etc.)

If any of these properties changes, the state of the system changes.

When properties do not change with time, the system is said to be in thermodynamic equilibrium.


✅ Thermodynamic Properties

Thermodynamic properties are measurable characteristics of a system that define its state, 
such as pressure, volume, temperature, and mass.

Types of Thermodynamic Properties
🔹 1. Intensive Properties

Properties that do not depend on the mass or size of the system.

They remain the same even if the system is divided into smaller parts.
Examples:


Temperature (T)


Pressure (P)


Density (ρ)


Specific heat


Refractive index


Concentration


Memory Trick:
Intensive = Independent of mass (I → Independent)

🔹 2. Extensive Properties

Properties that depend on the mass or size of the system.

If the system is divided, these properties split in the same ratio.
Examples:


Mass (m)


Volume (V)


Internal energy (U)


Enthalpy (H)


Entropy (S)


Number of moles (n)


Memory Trick:
Extensive = Expands with mass (E → Expands)

📌 Comparison Table

⭐ Special Note

Extensive property / mass = Intensive property

Example:


Volume (extensive) / mass → Specific volume (intensive)

Just say yes ✅


✅ State Variables (State Functions)

State variables are properties that depend only on the current state of the system, not on how the system reached that state.

They are determined by state parameters like P, V, T.

Even if the path changes, the value remains the same for the same state.

Examples

Pressure (P)

Volume (V)

Temperature (T)

Internal energy (U)

Enthalpy (H)

Entropy (S)

Density (ρ)

Key Point

If initial and final states are same → Change in state function = 0

✅ Path Variables (Path Functions)

Path variables depend on the path or process by which a system changes from one state to another.

Their values are determined by how the process occurs, not just initial and final states.

Examples

Heat (Q)

Work (W)

Key Point

Diffrence table:

If path changes → Heat & work change:

| Feature           | State Variables         | Path Variables   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| Depends on Path?  | ❌ No                    | ✅ Yes            |
| Depends on State? | ✅ Yes                   | ❌ No             |
| Symbol            | Usually capital letters | Q & W mainly     |
| Examples          | P, V, T, U, H, S        | Heat, Work       |
| Cyclic Process    | Δ(state function) = 0   | Total Q or W ≠ 0 |


✅ Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics

The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics states that if two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.

🔥 Meaning

If A is in thermal equilibrium with C

And B is in thermal equilibrium with C

Then
➡️ A and B will be in thermal equilibrium with each other
➡️ So they have the same temperatur

✅ Example

If a thermometer (C) is in thermal equilibrium with:

Hot water (A) → thermometer shows high reading

Ice water (B) → thermometer shows low reading

When thermometer shows same reading with both,
➡️ A and B are at the same temperature

✅ Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics

If two bodies are each in thermal equilibrium with a third body, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.

✅ Defines temperature
✅ Basis of thermometers
✅ Lets us compare temperatures correctly

Example:
If Body A and Body B both have the same temperature as a thermometer (Body C), then A and B are at the same temperature.

✅ First Law of Thermodynamics (Law of Energy Conservation)

Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another.

In thermodynamics:

Δ
𝑈
=
𝑄
−
𝑊
ΔU=Q−W

Where:
✅ ΔU = Change in internal energy
✅ Q = Heat supplied to system
✅ W = Work done by the system

Meaning:

Adding heat increases internal energy or does work

If system does work, its internal energy decreases

Example:
Heating gas in a piston — gas expands (work done) and internal energy increases.

✅ Second Law of Thermodynamics

Heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter body without external work.

✅ Introduces entropy (disorder)
✅ Heat flows hot → cold naturally
✅ No engine can be 100% efficient

Two famous statements:

✅ Kelvin–Planck Statement

No heat engine can convert all heat into work.

✅ Clausius Statement

Heat cannot flow from cold to hot without work.

✅ Entropy Concept

Entropy of an isolated system always increases or remains constant; it never decreases.

Δ
𝑆
≥
0
ΔS≥0

Natural processes are irreversible.

Example:

Ice melts → irreversible

Perfume spreads in a room → spontaneous, entropy increases

✅ Third Law of Thermodynamics

At absolute zero (0 K), entropy of a perfectly crystalline substance is zero.

✅ Impossible to reach absolute zero
✅ At 0 K, particles have minimum motion (theoretically)

| Law    | Key Idea                              | Formula / Concept     |
| ------ | ------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Zeroth | Defines **temperature & equilibrium** | A = B = C (temp wise) |
| First  | **Energy conserved**                  | ΔU = Q − W            |
| Second | **Entropy increases**, no 100% engine | ΔS ≥ 0                |
| Third  | **Entropy = 0 at 0 K**                | S → 0 as T → 0        |

| Zeroth | Temperature exists & can be measured       |
| First  | Energy can't be created or destroyed       |
| Second | Heat flows from hot to cold; entropy rises |
| Third  | Absolute zero → zero entropy (ideal)       |
