rerfation is process of light means when light travel from one mdeium to another it got bended then this method is known as refraction of light:
the refraction occur because of speed of light in diffrent diffrent mediums:

* when light travel from rarer medium to denser medium then light will be tillted toward normal:
* when light travel from denser to rarer medium it will move away from normal 

absolute refractive index of any medium is equal to nx= c/speed of light in that medium :

here refractive index is speed of light divide by speed of light in that medium so this is known as refractive index of that medium:

** refractive index icrease as denity increase:

there are two laws of refraction:
1)incident refracted and normal must lie on same plane:
2)angle of incidence and angle of refraction remains constant for a given pair of media: it is also known as snells law 
sini /sin r=1
