sound is form of energy that produce due to vibration of ovject to its soroounding:
make us to speak and human is able to hear whatever we speak : sound id measued in frequency

sound travel in the form of wave:
the wave form of sound is known as longitudnal wave:
in this the particle move back and forth in the same direction in which sound travel:

sound can not move in vaccum:
and sound can not travel in space that why two stronouts can not hear in between them what they both say to each othet for this they both need radio:


: Wave is disturbance that transfer energy from one place to another without the actutal transfer of matter:

: Transverse wave: it is the wave in which particle vibrate perpendicular to the direction of wave movement: eg: water wave, electromagnetic wave

: Longitudnal wave: here particle wave and wave motion both are parllel to each other: sound wave : earthquake primary wave:

: compression : here the wave or very close to each ither and here the pressure is high:

: rarefraction: here the wave or not close to each other and they are spread out so this is known as rarefraction:

DIFFRENCE BETWEEN TRANSEVERSE AND LONGITUDNAL WAVE:

| Feature            | Transverse Wave                     | Longitudinal Wave         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Particle direction | Perpendicular                       | Parallel                  |
| Medium requirement | Solids & liquid surface             | Solids, liquids & gases   |
| Wave components    | Crests & troughs                    | Compression & rarefaction |
| Examples           | Light, water waves                  | Sound, slinky waves       |
| Wave type          | Often mechanical or electromagnetic | Mechanical only           |


**wavelength:
the length betwwen two poiitn in one complete cycle in wave is known as wavelength:
means crest to crest or trough to trough this wavelength for transevers wave  and

compression to compression and rarefraction to rarefraction is in transeverse wave:

wavelength is measuerd in the form of meter (M)
relation between wavelength and speed and frequency= wvakength is denoted in lambda: lambda= speed/ freq:

so the red is having more wavelength and void let is having less wavelength and when frequency incresse the wvalength decrese and vice versa:


** Amplitude: the max position that the particle attain in crest and trough from mean position is known as amplitude:
and here amplitude is directly proportionol to loudness:   

loudneess= amplitude^2

* frequency: it is the number of wave or coccilation per second is known as frequency: it is measuerd in heartz:
f= 1/t;
here red light has low frequency and voilet light has high freq:

for human the audible range of frqncy is 20 hz to 20000 hz:

below 20HZ sound is infrasonic:

above 20,000 hz sound is ultrasonic:

Frequcny is inversaly proprtionl to wvalength:

Elactromagnetci wave:

radio , microwave,infrared, visible, UV , X-Ray, Gamma, Cosmic:

here radio have more wavelength so therir freq is low:

and cosmic and gamma ray have low wavelength so they have high freq:

Radio: it is used to roadcast in TV and Televison:
Micowave: it is used in cooking radar telephone and other signal:
infrared: transmit heat from sun, fires and radiators:
Visible: it make us to see the particle around us:
UV:absorebde y the sceen and used in florscent tube:
X-RAY: it is used to view inside of bidy:
Gamma: used in cancer killing cells:


**Pitch:
it tells us that weather sound is high or low:
high freq means: sound is high 
low freq: means sound is low:

loudness is measured in decibel:

| Property of Sound              | What it Means                   | Measured In                      |
