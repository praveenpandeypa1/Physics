Gravitatin is the attractive force that attracts two of the forcse sorrounds arounfd it:

Newtons law of gravitation:
 f= Gm1m2/r^2
 here gravitainol focre is product of masses and and inverstionl propprtionl to square of distance btween them :

Here G is known as universal gravitatnil constant with value= 6.57* 10^-11 nkg2/ms2

here some of the charcterstics of gravitation consatnt:
1)it is attractive forcese:
2)forcse is independent of medium:
3)valid for point massses:

mass= density* voulme:
