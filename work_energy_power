work= force * diplacement
si unit of work is NM:
1J=10^7 erg it is another SI unit od work:
work can be positive negative or 0 also:


kinetic energy: the energy due to motion of object is known as kinetic energy:
it depends on mass and velocity or speed of object:
ke= 1/2 mv^2:
Ke is scalar quantyty:
ifv double KE become 4 time:
if v is 3 then KE become 9 times:
if V is halved then KE become 1/4
if both the mass and velocity is doubled in KE then The new kinetic energy will be 8 times:
