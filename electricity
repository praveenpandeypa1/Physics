Charge is reprsented using Q: and SI unit of charge is columb:

there are two type of charge one is + and othe is - :
here like charge repel each other and opposoite charge attract each other:

si unit of charge is coloumb:

current= it os the rate of flow of charge: 
here si unit of current is apmpere: I= Q/T:
here 1mA =10^-3 and 1 micro amprere= 10^-6
direction of current is opposite to the flow of electrons:

Potential diffrence: it is the amount of work done to bring 1 unit of charge from one point to another:
it is denoted by V (volt)
si unit of potenital diffrence is Volt:
v=W/Q: so potential diffrence is work done per unit of charge:

electron flow from lower potentail to hiegher one:
and current flow from higher to lower:
combination of cells is known as battery:

Resistance: it is the method or the way to oppose the flow of electrons in conductors and it is known as resistance:
resitance depend on length area and trempratute and material resistivity:
SI unit of resistance is OHM:
and SI unit of resistivity is:
R= rho*l/a:
if temp increse then resistance will increase :
if temp decrse then resistivity will decraese:


resitivity: it is the property that do not change with shape and size of material like length area and temp and so on:
resistivity order= metals<alloys<insulator:
glass and rubber have high resistivity : thats why they are poor conductor:
SI unit of resitivity is ohm meter:
potenital diffrence is mesured by device called as : voltmeter:
current is measuerd by device name as Ammeter:
1m =10^-3
1cm=10^-2


Ohms law:
it basically states that if temprature is constant then potential diffrence is directly propotionol to current:
V=IR:

series combination:
here in series combination the current is same but potantial diffrence is diffrent:
and here at last all get aded r1 + r2+ r3:

here in parllel combination the Current will be diffrent but the potaintal is diffrence:

** IMportnt point: the tital resistance in series combination is more than the total resistenace in parllel combination:

Power: it is the way or the amount in which the electrical energy is consumed:
 p=v*I here p=i^2*r and many more:
SI unit of power is Watt:

energy = power * time and SI unit of energy is known as Joule: 1kwh= 3.6*10^6 joile:
