** the branch of physic that deals with the motion of object and that force that cause motion is knwon as mechanics:
** the motion part of mechanics are called kinematics:

**the forec part of mechanics are called dynmics:


** Distance = total distance covered are called as distance:

** Displacement: It is the smallest distnace between point A to Point B: it is the shortest path:

** diff in distance and displacement:
| Feature          | **Distance**                                       | **Displacement**                                                   |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Meaning          | Total path length covered by an object             | Shortest straight-line distance between initial and final position |

| Example          | You walk 5 m east + 5 m west → **distance = 10 m** | Starting and ending at same point → **displacement = 0 m**         |


** Speed: distance covered per unit of time :
**velocity= displacement per unit of time:

| Example             | Car moves 60 km in 1 hour → speed = **60 km/h**        | Car moves 60 km east in 1 hour → velocity = **60 km/h East**  |


** Sppedometer= it is used to measure the speed:

**odometer: it is used to measure the distance:


**Acceleration (Concept Explained Simply)

Acceleration is the rate at which velocity changes with time.
It tells how fast the velocity increases or decreases.

formula a  == v-u/t;   here a is acceleration v initial  velocity u final velocity and t is time taken:

** Types of accelaration:

| Type                                                 | Meaning                | Example                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Positive Acceleration**                            | Speed increases        | Car speeds up from 20 m/s to 30 m/s  |
| **Negative Acceleration (Retardation/Deceleration)** | Speed decreases        | Car slows down from 30 m/s to 10 m/s |
| **Zero Acceleration**                                | Speed remains constant | Car moving at constant 40 m/s        |


**Real-life Examples

When you press the accelerator → positive acceleration

When brakes are applied → negative acceleration

Moving in a straight road with constant speed → zero acceleration



Types of Motion (Simple Explanation)
1. Linear Motion

Motion in a straight line.

Examples

Car moving on a straight road

Train on straight track

Ball dropped from height

Types

Uniform linear motion → speed constant

Non-uniform linear motion → speed changes

2. Curvilinear Motion

Motion along a curved path.

Examples

Car turning on a curved road

Roller coaster

Ball thrown in air (projectile)

3. Circular Motion

Motion along a circular path around a fixed point.

Examples

Fan blades

Earth moving around the Sun

Merry-go-round rides

object moves in a circle around another point

4. Rotational Motion

Object rotates about its own axis.

Examples

Spinning top

Wheels of a bicycle

Earth rotating on its axis

object spins on its own center

5. Oscillatory Motion

Back-and-forth motion around a central position.

Examples

Pendulum

Swing

Tuning fork vibration

6. Periodic Motion

Motion that repeats itself at regular time intervals.

Examples

Pendulum clock

Earth’s revolution (1 year)

Second hand of a clock

oscillatory motion is always periodic
but periodic motion may not be oscillatory (Earth’s revolution)

7. Random Motion

Motion with no fixed direction or pattern.

Examples

Flying mosquito

Dust particles in air

Movement of fish in a pond

8. Projectile Motion

Motion under gravity in two dimensions (parabolic path).

Examples

Throwing a ball

Water fountain spray

Bullet fired at an angle

9. Translatory Motion

Every part of body moves same distance in same direction.

Examples

Moving bus

Lift going up/down

Sliding door

Types

Rectilinear translation → straight path

Curvilinear translation → curved path

One-Line Summary Table
Motion Type	Key Idea
Linear	Straight path
Curvilinear	Curved path
Circular	Moves around a point
Rotational	Spins on own axis
Oscillatory	To-and-fro motion
Periodic	Repeats in equal time
Random	No fixed pattern
Projectile	Parabolic path under gravity
Translatory	Whole body moves together


** there are 3 equation of motion:
1) v=u+at;
2)s=ut+1/2at^2;
3)v^2=u^2+2as;
