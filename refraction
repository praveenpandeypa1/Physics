** here critical angle is concept where when light move from denser to rarer medium  it will refract towrd the axis or 90 degree this is called as angle of refraction:
 ** critical angle only happens in when light rays move from denser to raere medium:


1)if angle of incidence is < critical angle then refraction:
2)if angle of incidence= critical angle then refraction angle 90 degree:
3)if angle of incidence > angle of refraction then tital internal reflection it happen only when angle of incidence is greaeter than critical angle:
