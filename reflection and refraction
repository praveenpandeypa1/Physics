Reflection= the bouncing beck of light is known as reflection means whenerevr the light comes and strike on mirror and then bounce back is known as reflection:

there are two laws of reflection:
i)incident ray reflected ary and normal all lie on same plane:
ii)angle of incidence = angle of reflection:

there are two type of miroor :
1)concave= converging miroor: torch, many more, dentist mirror
2)convex)= diverhing mirror : car mirrior


// Spehircal mirror:
pole: the center point on spherical mirror is known as pole :
center of curvature: the center of that complete sphere:
principal axis: the line that is drwan from ple to center of curvature
radius of curvature:the distance from the pole to center of curvature is radius of curvature:
focus: when incident ray come and incident on concave mirror and leter it get meet at principal axis at perticular point the point eher it meet is focus:
focal length: the distance from focus to pole is focal length hence radius is double of focal length:

// image formation rules for concave mirror:
 1 . if ray of light come parllel to principal exis and gets incident on mirror then it will pass through focus:
2   . if ray of light pass through focus then it will become parllel to principal axis:
3.. if ray of light pass through center of curvature then it willbe reverse back in the same direction:
 4)  if the ray of light pass through pole then it will be back in direction then angle of incidence = angle of reflection:


// Image fomation for concave mirror:
1)object is at infinity or beyound C then the image will be formed at between C and F and will be real , invertex and diminished:
2)when object is at C then the image formed will be at C only and it will be real, invertex and same size:
3)when object is between C and F then the image formed will be beyond C  and it will be real inverted and magnified:
4)when object is at focus the imagw will be formed will be real invertet and highly magnified and image will be at infinity:
5)when object is at between pole and focus then image will be at back of miroor and will be virtual erect and maginified:

Concave mirror use: dentis, car headlight, shaving mirror , torch, solar furnance


//** Image formation convex mirror rules:
1)when object is at infity then imag will be formed at between focus and pole  and it will be virtual erect diminished and upright:
use of convex miror is is in car rear view miroor:


**Very important:

here concave mirror always forms inverted image but convex mirror never form inverted image:
here convave mirror foem the virtual image and convex mirror also form virtual image but the diffrence is that convex image is small but concave virtual image is large:


Sign convention for concave mirror:
1)all distanve measured from and tworads x axis is +ve and popsoite of that is negative and all distance measured from the pole:
2)hight towrads upward and y axis is +ve and hiefht towarsd downward is negative -ve:


**Formula:
f= focal length= the distance from pole to focus :
u= object distance = the distance from pole to object:
v= the distance from pole to iamge is iaimee distance:

1/f=1v+1/u

** Important :
 1)here always keeps the object distance u as negative weather it is lens or miroor:
2) here focal length for concave mirror is always negativee and thet of convex mirror it is poitive:


//LENS: it is of two types:
1)convex= thick in middle is convex:
2)concave: thin in middle:

** optical center:it is a point on the lens where if any ray will be passed then it will pass with undeviated:
it is same as an pole of mirror: it is in center of lens:

Convex lens= it is converging lens and far better than concave lens and it is known as converging lens:

image formation rule for convex lens:

1)if any ray of light commin parllel to principal axis so after conveging they will pass through focus:
2)if ray of light pass through optical center tehn it will pass completly:
3)if ray of light pass through focus then become parllel to principal axis:


**Now image formation rules:
1)when object is at infinity: then image will be formed at F2 and inverted and highly diminished:
2)when object is beyond 2F1 then image will be between f2 and 2f2 and real inverted, diminshed:
3)object at 2F1: then image at 2F2 , real, inverted, same size:
4)object betweeen 2F1 and F1 then image will be beyond 2 F2 , real, inverted, magnified:
5)when object is at F1 then image will be at infinity, real, inverted, highly maginified:
6)when object is between F1 and O then image will be on same side of object virtual erect and magnified:



** image formation rules for concave lens that is only 2:
1)object is finite distance any wheer except infinity: then image will be formed between F1 and optical center vertual, erect and diminshed:
2)object is at infinity:image at F1 and virtal erect and highly diminshed

** power of lens: it tells that what is the power of your lens and it is measuerd in diaptore:
p=1/f p=p1+p2+p3.... 

if the power is positive then it is convex lens:
if the power is negative then its concave lens:
